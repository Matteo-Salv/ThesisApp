# ThesisApp - Under development
## Computer Engineering - Software Platforms and Cybersecurity, University of Genoa
This App is a part of my work for the Bachelor Degree Thesis named 'Automatic Dynamic Analysis on iOS platform'. 
## Target development
* iOS 14.4+
* native support for iPhone 6S+
* no support for iPadOS
## More info
essentially, this App can be used to test and play with Appium Automation. There are some objects that UIKit provides (for example labels, switches, buttons) and a section in which it is possible to interact with some system authorizations (bluetooth, location, contacts, calendar) officially named 'Protected Resources' in Apple documentation.
Actually, some sections are empty/not fully working, as the title says the App is still under development.
The 'System Calls' section is under construction as well, my idea is to use it to stimulate some specific syscalls.

Please note that I'm a novice with Swift (In fact, this is the first App entirely developed by me). If you find some ingenouous parts of code please be shy and open an issue, any advice is appreciated.

At the moment I will not share the work I'm doing for the thesis (at least, until the degree).
