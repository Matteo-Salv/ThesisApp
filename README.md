# ThesisApp
## Computer Engineering - Software Platforms and Cybersecurity, University of Genoa
This App is part of my work for the Bachelor Degree Thesis named 'Automatic Dynamic Analysis on iOS platform'. 
## Target development
* iOS 14.4+
* native support for iPhone 6S+
* no support for iPadOS
## More info
essentially, this App can be used to test and play with Appium Automation. There are some objects that UIKit provides (for example labels, switches, buttons) and a section in which it is possible to interact with some system authorizations (bluetooth, location, contacts, calendar) officially named 'Protected Resources' in Apple documentation.
It is present a section dedicated to obtain some System Information.

Please note that I'm a novice with Swift (In fact, this is the first App entirely developed by me).
